This is just the ramblings of a Minecraft mod developer named Cazzar, most of his projects are open source on github, with the exception of a few, which are still hosted over at [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org/cazzar)

I am a massive gamer, enjoying games such as Team Fortress 2, Borderlands 2, Half-Life, Portal and many more, and generally said to be a nice person to talk to.

Have any suggestions for me to write up on the site? you can contact me via email, github or even via [IRC](/irc/)

If you want to negotiate a donation, via any other schemes other than [Patreon](https://patreon.com/cazzar) chuck me an email and I will be happy to work it out.
