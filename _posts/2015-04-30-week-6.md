This one brought up something interestng for me when looking around at the japanese word for goddess, 女神, whereas some people would recognise both of these Kanji as 女 (おんな/On'na) which, is woman as a literal translation.
Whereas the 2nd kanji within the word goddess, 神 (かみ/Kami) when combined, spoken, using the romanji is **Megami** instead of **On'na kami**
