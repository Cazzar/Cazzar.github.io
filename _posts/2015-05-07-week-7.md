When this was released I was actually at work though, what ended up happening is, I decided to watch it when I got home, some of the things described by the nicely provided by the artist [Michie M](https://plus.google.com/+MichieM) and as always I have enjoyed Michie's work as well as the good work done by the others for the music videos, this time, done by [cort](http://ameblo.jp/cort-blog/)

I also must thank [Michie M](https://plus.google.com/+MichieM) for also including english subtitles with the video as well, it helps me figure out the meaning of such a song a lot easier, without having to wait weeks for a fan translation, and also the great social contact [Michie M](https://plus.google.com/+MichieM) seems to have around his releases.

I also love the reference of 39 within the works here, they appear all over the place, especially around miku, there is more to that as well. I should also upload more banners for these videos.
