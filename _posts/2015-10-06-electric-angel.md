So, recently I installed Sublime Text 3 for some of its plugins, though I personally might be flicking back to Visual Studio Code from time to time, especially when it gets back to some of it's plugin APIs, maybe even looking at installing ones myself.

Though onto other things. How I initially found this song was after introducing this to a friend, she linked this back to me about 2 years ago before my final exams of High School (Year 12) and this song, was stuck in my head for quite a while.

I do quite like this song itself, it is quite nice, there are also some other instances of this online, though I need more content for this site, so I might also just do some ramblings for it.
