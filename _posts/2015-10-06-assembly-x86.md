So, I was also recently dabbling quite a bit in the x86 assembly side of things. Though right now I have only really worked in with the basic instruction sets, I have mostly been able to self-teach myself a lot of the works.

There is online a nice YouTube playlist done by [OpenSecurityTraining.info](http://www.opensecuritytraining.info/IntroX86.html) which outlines the basics of x86 assembly. This I have found alongside the wikibooks to be quite a useful set of references to learn x86 assembly.

I have also thought of making something based off TIS-100 in unity that could be used as an educational game to help suppliment teaching and hand-writing assembly code itself, though as I only know small parts of assembly, it will definately be a work in progress, and a nich√® within itself though I don't know how successful it may be, even if I manage to finish it.
