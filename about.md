This is just the ramblings of a Minecraft mod developer named Cazzar, most of his projects are open source on github, with the exception of a few, which are still hosted over at [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org/cazzar)

I am a massive gamer, and generally said to be a nice person to talk to, Feel free to join me in #cazzar on irc.esper.net! [webchat](http://webchat.esper.net/)
